# MyRetailPOC
A POC on RESTful webservice
# Description
myRetail is a rapidly growing company with HQ in Richmond, VA and over 200 stores across the east coast. myRetail wants to make its internal data available to any number of client devices, from myRetail.com to native mobile apps.

The goal for this exercise is to create an end-to-end Proof-of-Concept for a products API, which will aggregate product data from multiple sources and return it as JSON to the caller.

Here i am creating a RESTful service that can retrieve product name and price details by product id. 

### This application performs the following actions:
- Responds to an HTTP GET request at /products/{id} and delivers response as a JSON.
- Performs a HTTP GET request to retrieve the product name from an external API.
- Retrieves price information from Mongo data store and combines it with response JSON.
- Accepts a HTTP PUT request at /products/{id} and update the productâ€™s price in the Mongo DB data store.
